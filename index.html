    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm a second-year student at the University of Mines and Technology, studying Computer Science and Engineering. I'm really into learning about how computers works and how to build cool things with them. Right now, I'm focusing on my classes, where I'm getting the hang of programming, algorithms, and all sorts of tech stuff. I'm not just about the books, I'm excited about putting what I learn into practice, like through internships and projects. I'm looking forward to using my skills to make a difference in the tech world. Let's see where this journey takes me!
